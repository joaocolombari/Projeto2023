## Objectives
This repository is dedicated to the project for the SEL5752 course - Reconfigurable Devices and Hardware Description Languages. The project aims to study, modify, and test an implementation in VHDL of the RISC-V architecture, RV32I version, single-cycle, based on the implementation described by Harris and Harris [1].

## Project Development
The directory corresponding to this repository served as the foundation for the entire project development. Subdirectories were used for simulations and editing ".vhd" files. The structure of the directory provided, after making changes related to the project development, is as follows:

54 directories
```
The "DE10_LITE" subdirectory is dedicated to housing files generated for testing the architecture structures using the DE10-Lite FPGA kit, which is based on the MAX 10 - 10M50DAF484C7G chip. This FPGA serves as the hardware platform for implementing and testing the RISC-V processor as part of the SEL5752 course. A project named "DE10_LITE_riscvsingle" was created inside of it using the DE10_Lite_SystemBuilder.exe application.

Within this subdirectory, additional directories such as "db," "incremental_db," and "top_level_files" can be found. These directories contain various files and information related to the FPGA design and configuration. The "db" directory might contain databases or other project-related data, while "incremental_db" could include incremental compilation databases, and "top_level_files" likely contains files crucial for the top-level design of the FPGA project.

It's worth noting that the structure and contents of these directories are typically managed by the tools provided by the FPGA development environment, such as Quartus II. The specifics may vary based on the tools and settings used in your project.

Moving on to the "docs" directory, it encompasses all the necessary documentation and outputs required for the project. This includes error logs, RTL Viewer prints generated by the Quartus II software, syntax check results from the GHDL Open Source terminal application, and videos demonstrating the functionality of the implemented programs on the FPGA. Each activity within the "docs" directory has its own subdirectory, providing a structured organization for documentation related to specific project tasks. In each activity subdirectory within "docs," there is a markdown file describing the changes and procedures undertaken for that specific activity. These markdown files serve as activity reports, detailing progress, modifications made, and any challenges encountered throughout the development of the project. Some reports will have fisrt and second part and those reffer to the ones in which the FPGA was loaded and tested. In these second parts, this will be stated. 

The "modelsim" directory holds files associated with the ModelSim simulator, a tool commonly used for simulating and debugging hardware designs described in hardware description languages like VHDL.

In the "quartus" directory, there are files generated by the Quartus II software, which is a comprehensive FPGA development tool. This includes databases, incremental compilation databases, and output files associated with the compilation and synthesis of your project.

Finally, the "src" directory contains source files written in VHDL. These files were incompletely provided by the professor and serve as the foundation for your project. The authors task was to complete and modify these source files according to the requirements outlined in the project proposal. The hardware description language files play a crucial role in defining the behavior and structure of the digital circuits to be implemented on the FPGA.

The main references were the video lessons available for the students on the course's Moodle, [1], and [2]. If the reader have any specific questions or if there's a particular aspect you'd like more information on, he or she may feel free to ask!
